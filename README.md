## The Problem

People with ADHD often struggle with "time blindness" - difficulty sensing how much time has passed or remains. Traditional timers don't provide enough awareness until it's too late, and most productivity apps aren't designed with ADHD brains in mind.

## The Solution

TimeWise works **backward from your deadline** and provides continuous visual feedback with ADHD-friendly features:

### Core Features

- **Reverse Scheduling** - Set your target time, app calculates when to start each task
- **Visual Time Awareness** - Screen changes color as time runs out:
  - **Green**: More than 50% time remaining 
  - **Orange**: 25-50% time remaining (heads up!)
  - **Red**: Less than 25% time remaining (time to focus!)
- **Smart Audio Alerts** - Customizable beeps and alarms that cut through ADHD hyperfocus
- **Adaptive Learning** - Tracks how long tasks actually take and adjusts future estimates
- **Screen Wake Lock** - Keeps your device awake during timers

### Advanced Task Management

- **Quick-Add Tasks** - 12 common tasks with realistic time estimates (Shower, Coffee, Travel, etc.)
- **Drag & Drop Reordering** - Easily reorganize tasks with visual feedback
- **Learning Analytics** - See how your actual times compare to estimates
- **Visual Task Icons** - Icons make scanning your task list effortless

### Routine Templates

- **Save Routines** - Create templates like "Morning Routine," "Work Prep," "Date Night"
- **One-Click Loading** - Load complete routines instantly
- **Duplicate & Modify** - Copy routines to create variations
- **Persistent Storage** - Routines save automatically in your browser

### Customizable Audio

- **Multiple Alert Sounds** - Gentle Beep, Chime, Soft Tone for warnings
- **Multiple Alarm Sounds** - Urgent, Classic, Gentle for time-up alerts
- **Volume Controls** - Separate sliders for alerts vs alarms
- **Preview Function** - Test sounds before selecting

## How It Works

1. **Set your target time** - When you need to be somewhere (e.g., 10:00 AM)
2. **Add your tasks** - Use quick-add buttons or create custom tasks
3. **Reorder if needed** - Drag tasks to optimize your routine
4. **Generate schedule** - App calculates when to start each task
5. **Visual feedback** - Screen color keeps you aware without being overwhelming
6. **Audio alerts** - Gentle warnings and clear alarms
7. **Learn and improve** - App learns your patterns and suggests better time estimates

## Interface Design

Built with ADHD brains in mind:

- **Clean, focused interface** - Collapsible sections reduce overwhelm
- **Intuitive visual cues** - Colors, icons, and clear typography
- **Smart defaults** - Most important features visible, others one-click away
- **Reduced cognitive load** - See only what you need, when you need it

## Example Routines

- **"School Morning"** - Shower, coffee, pack bag, travel (45 min total)
- **"Work Prep"** - Coffee, check phone, get dressed, commute (35 min total)
- **"Quick Exit"** - Grab essentials, check weather, go (8 min total)
- **"Date Night"** - Shower, hair, makeup, get dressed (90 min total)

## Smart Features for ADHD

- **"Check Phone" task** - Includes 50% padding because we know how this goes!
- **"Coffee/Tea" task** - 10 minutes because ADHD brains deserve proper wake-up time
- **Realistic shower times** - 25 minutes, not the unrealistic 10 most apps assume
- **Gentle progression** - Orange warning at 50% remaining gives plenty of heads-up time
- **Visual task numbers** - Easy to see your routine order at a glance
