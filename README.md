# TimeWise: ADHD 🧠
A time management app designed specifically for ADHD time blindness with visual cues and adaptive learning.

## The Problem
People with ADHD often struggle with "time blindness" - difficulty sensing how much time has passed or remains. Traditional timers don't provide enough awareness until it's too late.

##The Solution
TimeWise works **backward from your deadline** and provides continuous visual feedback:

### How It Works:
1. **Set your target time** - When you need to be somewhere (e.g., 10:00 AM)
2. **Add your tasks** - Shower, breakfast, getting dressed, travel time
3. **Generate schedule** - App calculates when to start each task
4. **Visual feedback** - Screen changes color as time runs out:
   - 🟢 **Green**: More than 50% time remaining 
   - 🟠 **Orange**: 25-50% time remaining (heads up!)
   - 🔴 **Red**: Less than 25% time remaining (urgency!)
5. **Audio alerts** - Gentle beeps at transitions, distinct alarm when time's up
6. **Learns from you** - Tracks how long tasks actually take and adjusts future estimates
